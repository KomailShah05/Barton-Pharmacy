The only way to find out if your blood pressure is high is to have your blood pressure checked.

At Westlake Pharmacy, we provide Blood Pressure Monitoring in the privacy of our consultation room. Your result will be explained to you and you will be offered any advice and support needed to manage your blood pressure. If appropriate, we may refer you to your doctor.

If the Pharmacist feels like Levonelle One Step is not suitable for you, they will not give you the morning-after pill, but advise you to see your health care professional.`

Anyone can catch head lice, regardless of whether your hair is long or short and clean or dirty. However they’re passed by direct head-to-head contact head lice can’t jump, swim or fly so children are more likely to catch them and pass them around when playing with friends at nursery or school. Head lice are small insects, up to 3mm long and can be difficult to spot. Head lice eggs (nits) are yellow, brown or white (empty shells) and are attached to the hair.

Head lice can make your head feel itchy or like something is moving in your hair. The only way to be sure someone has head lice is by finding live lice or eggs. You can do this by combing their hair with a special fine-toothed comb.`,

Being overweight and the complications associated with excess weight is a growing concern that is becoming more prominent. Currently, in the UK, 63% of adults are classed as either overweight or obese.
It is widely understood that carrying excess body fat can lead to serious health complications such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. Obesity is also one of the leading causes of preventable cancers in the UK contributing to one in 20 of all cases.

Here at Westlake Pharmacy, we understand that each customer’s weight management journey is personal, that is why we provide a wide range of products that can help you lose excess fat the right way. Losing weight is not easy for anyone but setting goals that are both achievable and sustainable is the best way towards a healthier and happier lifestyle.

It’s no secret that a balanced, nutritious diet along with regular exercise is the safest way to lose weight and to keep it off long-term. But if you’re obese, you may need more help than this.

If appropriate, our pharmacist may be able to offer you clinically proven medication to help you lose weight, making sure it is suitable for you and your particular needs, and that it does not interact with other medicines you may already be taking. If the pharmacist identifies any extra medical issues, you will always be referred back to your GP.`

ED is very common with an estimated 50% of men between the ages of 40 and 70 suffering to some degree. There are various causes of ED, divided into psychological (i.e. stress, anxiety and depression) and physical (i.e. high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol and diabetes) causes. ED may be caused by a serious underlying condition and even if not can still be upsetting for the sufferer and put strain on relationships. It is therefore important to seek medical advice and treatment options.
At Westlake Pharmacy we offer a discreet, confidential Erectile Dysfunction service involving an initial questionnaire and screening. We will then discuss the different treatment options available to you and whether we can offer a suitable treatment or whether an appointment with your GP will be necessary.`,

		  It is estimated that 73 million inhalers are used in the UK every year. This number is only set to climb as the respiratory conditions increases. Once an inhaler has been used and there are no further doses inside, it should be recycled.<p></p>
<p>Unfortunately, many are unaware of the correct ways to discard of inhalers and subsequently, they are more likely to be disposed of in a local landfill to slowly degrade and cause environmental harm to the planet as residual gas from the canisters is slowly leaked, releasing harmful CO2 emissions that rival those of roughly 58,000 cars on the road (based on a yearly figure).</p>
<p><strong>Our Inhaler Recycling policy and process</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to inhaler recycling – all used inhalers should be returned to a pharmacy to be disposed of safely. Westlake Pharmacy will help with that.</p>
<p>Inhalers can be disposed of by the pharmacist along with other normal drugs waste. The plastic and aluminium parts of the inhaler can be used in other useful products, and any potentially dangerous greenhouse gasses can be collected to avoid releasing them into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This environmentally safe disposal route is available at our pharmacy. If your inhaler is out of date or serving you no purpose, don’t let it be destined for the landfill. Take action and bring it in to be recycled at our pharmacy, we’ll be more than happy to have it recycled for you</p>
